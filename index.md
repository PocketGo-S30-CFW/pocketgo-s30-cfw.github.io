The Pocket-Go S30 (also known as Miyoo-350 as marked on the board) is an Allwinner A33 SOC (sun8i) based console.

The original firmware (OFW) modifications have not been published by the vendor, therefore breaching the GPL license its software is based upon. This page is a summary of the efforts to develop an open source firmware based on the available open source sunxi/allwinner u-boot and kernels.
